## Getting started

Before install module, please check pnpm installed or you can run code below to install pnpm globally.

```bash
> npm install -g pnpm
```

```bash
# install dependencies
> yarn install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve
```

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

```bash
# install dependencies

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> pnpm serve
```
